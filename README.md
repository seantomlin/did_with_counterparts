# Replication material for Tomlin and Lu (2025+)

Two files are listed here. 

The first is the code used to construct the MEPS datasets used in the paper. This is a pooled four-year dataset and a pooled two-year dataset, pre-processed for our analysis. MEPS data can be accessed at [MEPS website](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_results.jsp?cboDataYear=All&cboDataTypeY=1%2CHousehold+Full+Year+File&buttonYearandDataType=Search&cboPufNumber=All&SearchTitle=Longitudinal).This file also contains the four-year MEPS analysis discussed in the Web Appendices.

The second file provides code needed for reproducing the synthetic data analysis from Section 6 in the main article.
